## üìä What is Accointing Desktop App?

Accointing Desktop App is the dedicated desktop version of the popular Accointing platform, offering enhanced speed, privacy, and offline capabilities for serious cryptocurrency users. It consolidates all your exchange accounts, wallets, and transactions into a single, intuitive interface, making portfolio tracking and tax reporting more efficient than ever.

With direct API and wallet integrations, the app automatically imports your transactions from hundreds of supported exchanges, blockchains, and DeFi protocols. This eliminates manual data entry and ensures your records are always accurate. Advanced analytics give you detailed breakdowns of holdings, performance trends, and realized/unrealized gains, allowing for better decision-making.

A standout feature of Accointing Desktop App is its crypto tax report generator, which calculates gains and losses according to your local tax regulations. You can choose between FIFO, LIFO, and other accounting methods, and export compliant tax documents in just a few clicks. The app supports multiple jurisdictions, making it ideal for both individual investors and professional accountants handling client portfolios.

The desktop version stores your sensitive financial data locally, with optional encryption for maximum security. Offline mode allows you to work with imported data without an internet connection, and real-time sync ensures that once you're online, your portfolio stays up to date.

Accointing Desktop App also offers market analytics, including historical price charts, asset allocation views, and performance benchmarks against major indices. Whether you‚Äôre a casual investor or a high-volume trader, it provides the insights and compliance tools you need in one streamlined application.
